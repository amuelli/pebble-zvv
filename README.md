# pebble-zvv
pebble-zvv is a Pebble Smartwatch app for quickly looking up live departures of bus, tram and trains at your favourite or nearby stations in Zurich.
It currently only supports Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel.

This app was heavily inspired by the [Time for Coffee!](http://timeforcoffee.ch) project.
